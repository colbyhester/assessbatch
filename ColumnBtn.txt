ColumnBtn.cmp
This component corresponds to when a user creates a new assignment and assign it a max value 
as well as when the user clicks on the column of the assignment they have created, they have an option to
delete or edit that category essentially. Also the  save button is a button that, based on the do-burrito method
it will spin to load but it will go back to the original save icon.

ColumnBtnController.cls 
We dictate the with sharing because we want to be able to share the records via apex.
Within the code our goal is to pull the categories and the values for the picklist for the modal as well as
saving those assignments and inserting the grades.

ColumnBtnController.js 
This controller dictates what is happening when a user closes or open the modal. It also 
pulls from the controller to get a list of categories to insert in the modal options: i.e: what happens when
a button is saved, when the weeks are changed, and we set the associates up with the corresponding assignments.

ColumnBtnHelper.js
This controller creates the grades for the modals while setting the necessary parameters and checking to see if the
state is successful. Also this helper class checks to see if the event fires and that the table will refresh with the 
new grades.
