**caliber header bar 
CaliberHeaderBar.cmp
This component contains the header bar. In the header bar we should have 
the following:
-revature logo/home page link
-home button
-manage batch button
-assess batch button
-quality audit button 
-panel
-reports 
-settings
For the home logo, it is actually added as a background image in css. The rest of the buttons 
are using float: right, the first one to be read is the one that goes to the 
right-hand of the container, and the ones read after it get placed to the left of the previous button
so they have to be added in reverse order to match the original sequence.

CaliberHeaderBarController.js 
We created 3 functions, 1 to handle when a user clicks the home logo it will redirect 
the user to the homepage, 2. settingsHandleChange when the user clicks on settings it will take them
to their corresponding settings page, and 3. handleclick, so when the user clicks on the any of the pages they will be redirected to that page.

headerController.cls
We want to return all the batches that started or ended in a specific year. Then we want to return the list
of years that have batches starting in them. After we build a list of strings for all batches in a year and we want to
return the number of weeks in a batch along with the strings for each week in a batch and we want to
date.
