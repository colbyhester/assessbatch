This class is used to translate the javascript functions into Apex code. The purpose of this code is to for the trainer to input a max point and have the assignments based on them as well as the section and weekly average.

    1. pointstoPercent
We take in two parameters, the list of assessments and an integer index, then grab the number of points from the index where we are accessing the trainer points. 
Afterwards we want to calculate the total points so we set an initial decimal variable pointsum and along with a for loop we are basing the max to be the assessments size.
 If i is less then the total number of assessments we want the pointsum to equal that assessments index points that the trainer put in. 
 Afterwards we want to return the average so we would have the trainer points over the pointsum multiplied by 100.
      2. sectionAverage
For this method we take in a list of grades from the caliber object and we want to iterate through the grades. 
We set the initial score sum and through use of a for loop we want to create a list of decimals up to the size of the grades and we add them.
 We want to return the scoresum over the grade size.
      3. weeklyBatchAverage
For this method we take in a list of assessments as our parameters. This method uses the sectionAverage method and divides by the size. 
We want to create a list of grades where we select the score from the caliber grade object. We want to create a list of grades where we query through scores from the
caliber grade object and where the param variable is the assessment id.
We then want the total average to sum up to the list of grades in the sectionAverage callback.
We then want to return the total average over the weekavg size.
