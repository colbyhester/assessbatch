~~~~SaveButton Component~~~~
This Component is used to help ensure the onBlur is successful, by allowing users to move off a input field. The button itself has no interaction with the database and has no actual affect on saving or data. 

~~~~SaveButtonController.js~~~~

doBurrito

This function is called when the button is pressed. It hides the button and displays a loading icon (fa fa-spinner fa-spin fa-3x).

 We have two nested functions inside, both being a setTimeout. The first setTimeout will display a green check mark after 2 seconds from when the function is called. The second setTimeout will un-hide the button after 2 seconds from the first setTimeout.
