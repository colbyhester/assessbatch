Other Considerations:
	-Clean up code 
		- naming conventions for variables/attributes and functions
		- delete commented out code, as well as functions and attributes that are not used
	-Future Functionality/Performance Improvement
		-Automatically update weekly batch averages (convince Patrick to move calculations to front end?)
		-Re-work code to use less dynamically created components
		-Re-work events to be Component Events (currently all events are Application Events)
		-Re-work code so that more data is retrieved per server call, so that less server calls are made (query 
        for all notes at once instead of one by one)
	-Bugs
		-Currently unable to set the default Assessment Category Name to the proir value when editing an 
        Assessment.
			-In order for the Assessment Category to be updated, the user needs to select another option from 
            the list (If above bug is addressed this bug is not relevant)
		-The user is not automatically redirected to the newly created tab after the + tab is clicked
