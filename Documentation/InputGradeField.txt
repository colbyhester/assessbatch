**********INPUTGRADEFIELD COMPONENT**********

This component represents a single grade field that is displayed within the batchTableRow component. It is 
used to give trainers the ability to add a Caliber_Grade__c record to specific Caliber_Assessment__c record that is
linked to a Contact(trainee). It is composed of a simple <lightning:input> component that was then modified to 
be much smaller, as to avoid unneeded clutter on each row. Below we will describe the different methods used by
this component and how to use them. 

**CONTROLLERS**

1. INPUTGRADEFIELDCONTROLLER.APXC

This is the server-side controller for the InputGradeField component, and serves as the means of pulling 
information from the database to use in populating the Caliber_Grade__c fields that are shown to users. From 
within this controller, we have two methods that handle the operations necessary to the component, which are 
detailed below. 

GETGRADE 

This method is in charge of fetching the Caliber_Grade__c record associated with the Id of the assessment and 
associate that the note would be linked to. First it checks to see if a grade exists that meets those criteria, 
and if one does not, it creates one with a default value of 0. This ensures that even if there is not an existing
grade for the assessment and associate in question, one will be created for the trainer to then update as the need
arises. Whichever result is determined is then sent back to the client-side controller to be handled. 

Parameters: Id of assessment, Id of associate 

SAVEGRADE

This method is used to update and return a specified Caliber_Grade__c record that has been altered within the 
component. This is accomplished by passing it the grade in question, and then calling the update DML command to 
change it within the database. This allows users to dynamically update the grades for trainees and ensures that 
the new values will carry over when the page is reloaded. 

Parameters: Caliber_Grade__c object needing to be updated

2. INPUTGRADEFIELDCONTROLLER.JS

This is the client-side controller for the InputGradeField component. It is responsible for making calls to the 
server through its controller and handling the values returned by those calls. By exchanging data this way, users
are able to manipulate records within the database and have them still be accurate and intact each time they log
into the application. Below we will detail each of the methods that are found in this controller, as well as what 
they accomplish. 

DOINIT

This is the very first function that is called upon the component being loaded. From this function, a server call
is made to get the grade needed for the specified assessment and week number for that batch. The value of that 
grade is then passed to the component to display to the user. When all of this is done, the component should have 
all the values of any existing grades in the component. 

Method called: getGrade
Parameters: Id of assessment for grade, Id of associate in question

HANDLEBLUR 

This function is used to save the contents of a grade field after it has been altered by a user. As stated by 
the product owner, it was important to have these values be saved automatically after clicking away from the 
field. This led to the use of a blur event to call this function, which makes a server-side call to the saveGrade 
method in our Apex controller to update the grade and return it back to the client-side controller. From that 
point, the new value will persist through the page being reloaded, as it was updated within the database itself. 

Method called: saveGrade 
Parameters: Caliber_Grade__c object being updated
