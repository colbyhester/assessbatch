weekTabMenu.cmp
	The weekTabMenu component houses the week tabs. Users can select a week tab to view the corresponding 
    batchTable. Users can also add new week tabs by clicking on the + tab. Week tabs cannot be deleted. As soon 
    as the component loads, the appropriate number of tabs are created based on how many weeks the selected batch 
    has.
	
weekTabMenuController.js
	doInit
		This function runs when the component is rendered. It sends a request to the server, calling 
        getBatch(batchID). If a response is recieved, the returned Training__c record is saved to the component, 
        and a new week tab is generated for each week in the batch beyond the first, by calling hlpr.addTab().
	handleActive
		This function is called when a user clicks on a week tab. The logic is contained in helper.handleActive().
	handleAddTab
		This function is called when a user clicks on the + tab. It calls helper.addTab() to create the tab, then 
        sends the current batch to the server to be updated with the new number of weeks. The returned updated 
        Training__c record is the saved to the component.
	addContent
		This function is no longer in use and should be removed.
	testFocus
		This function is no longer in use and should be removed.
		
weekTabMenuHelper.js
	handleActive
		This function is called by the controller when a user clicks on a week tab. It obtains the week number from 
        the tab's id attribute and passes it to injectComponent() along with the tab itself, the batchID and the 
        component to be injected (c:batchTable). Then, a weekChangeEvent is fired to notify other components that 
        the user has selected a new week tab.
	injectComponent
		This function dynamically inserts a batchTable component with the relevant week and batchID attributes into 
        the specified tab.
	addTab
		This function is called to dynamically create week tabs. It determines what week the tab should be for 
        based on how many week tabs already exist, then creates the appropriate tab with the relevant attributes: 
        label, id, class and onactive.
