**********BATCHTABLE COMPONENT**********

This component is used to display the list of all trainees that are associated with a given batch. On the
component, there are multiple columns displaying the name of the trainee, any grades for assessments that 
were given for a given week, as well as any notes made by their trainer to describe their overall performance.
In order to show all the rows for each trainee, the batchTableRow component is nested within this component 
equal to the number of trainees there are for the specified batch. For more information about that component,
please refer to its corresponding documentation.

**CONTROLLERS**

1. BATCHTABLECONTROLLER.APXC

This is the server-side controller for the batchTable component, which allows it to communicate with the database.
Within it are several of the core methods needed to display the correct information within the table, such as the
trainees for the given batch, as well as their grades and notes. Below we will given a brief rundown on each 
method(which is also provided in the code for each class as well) to help give a better understanding on how and 
when to call each of them. 

GETASSOCIATES

This method is used to get a list of all the Contacts(trainees) associated with a given Training__c(batch). As
mentioned, it takes in an Id equal to the one of the batch you want to get the list from. Using this Id, it then
cycles through all the Contacts in the database and saves a list of all the ones who are linked to the batch that
has the Id, which is then returned to the user. 

Parameters: Id of the batch you want to pull trainees from

GETNOTE

This method is used to get the note that is associated to a specified Contact and week number, which are passed in
as parameters. Using these values, it cycles through all existing notes to find the one that is linked to the 
trainee and week in question. If one does exist, it is returned to the user. If one does not already exist, then 
one is created with no contents and associated with the trainee and week number specified in the parameters. This 
ensures that even if no note was made yet for a trainee during a certain week, there would always be one available
to edit for the trainer. 

Parameters: Decimal of week number, Id of associate

SAVENOTE

This method takes in a Caliber_Note__c object as a parameter that has been modified by a user within the 
component, and simply updates it. After the update has been committed to the database, it is returned to the
user. 

Parameters: Id of note you are updating

2. BATCHTABLECONTROLLER.JS

This is the client-side controller for the component. It is responsible for sending requests to the server-side 
component and handling the results of those calls. Its main purpose is to fetch a list of the trainees, notes, 
assessments, and grades for the table to be displayed. Below are a list of all the functions that are within this 
controller and what they do. 

DOINIT

This is the initial function that is immediately ran upon loading the component, and is responsible for fetching
all the associates needed for the table being shown by calling the getAssociates method in the server-side 
controller. This list is then sent back to the component to be used in generating all the different batchTableRow 
components for each trainee that is returned. 

Parameters(for server-side controller): Id of batch being sent to Apex controller

SAVENOTES

This function is responsible for taking the updated note field that a user has entered and sending its value to 
the server-side controller to be saved. This is accomplished by calling the saveNote method from the server-side 
controller and having it update the ntoe in question within the database. This allows users to make dynamic 
changes to note fields and have them retain those changes anytime the page is refreshed. 

Parameters: Id of note you want to update 

HANDLESENTID

This function is a handler for when the component is sent a new batch Id (such as when a new batch is selected).
This effectively sets the value of the batchId attribute within the component to the value that was sent to the 
component, which refreshes the table to show the list fo trainees from the specified batch instead. 

Parameters: None

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

This component requires a handler to listen for the custom sendBatchId event, which is fired when the user 
selects a new batch from the filters on the top of the page. This is necessary to ensure the table is populated 
with the correct list of trainees that apply to the newly-selected batch.
