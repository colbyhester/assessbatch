**********BATCHTABLEROW COMPONENT**********

This component is responsible for displaying a single row within the BatchTable component, and contains the 
name of a trainee, any assessment grades they ahve recieved, and any notes made by their trainer for the week. 


****CONTROLLERS****

1. BATCHTABLECONTROLLER.APXC

This controller is the same as the controller used for the BatchTable component. For more information, please
refer to that component's documentation. 

2. BATCHTABLEROWCONTROLLER.JS

This is the client-side controller for the BatchTableRow component, and handles making calls to the server for
pulling information and sending information between it. Below we will detail the different functions and how
to use them. 

DOINIT

This is the default function that is called when the component is loaded, and is responsible for getting all the 
grades and notes for each row from the server. This is accomplished by calling the getNote and getGrade methods 
from the BatchTableController.apxc file, and passing the required parameters for them from the component (more
on this below). 

Parameters: getNote - Decimal week number, Id of associate
            getGrade - Id of assessment, Decimal week number

HANDLESAVE

This function is responsible for saving a specified note's contents after they ahve been altered by a user. It 
is automatically called through the use of a blur event that is fired whenever a user clicks off of the note 
field being changed. The function takes the Id of the note, passes it to the server-side controller in the 
saveNote method, and then handles the returned results by saving the contents of the note to be the same as the 
results. 

Parameters: Id of the note that is being updated 

DYNCOMP 

This function is responsible for creating the grade and note components within itself to display the correct 
fields for trainers to edit and update. These components include both the notes for each trainee as well as the 
grades that may exist for any assessments that were created for the given week. This is accomplished by 
dynamically creating those components after determining the required number of each. This is determined by having
the function be called each time the component is sent a "DynComp" event from the BatchTable component, which 
creates the grade components needed. 

Parameters: None
