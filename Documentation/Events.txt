*********** EVENTS ***********

This document is meant to describe the overall functionality that each event is meant to accomplish. For more 
detailed information on how these events are used, visit the documentation for its associated components. 

1. SENDBATCHID

This event has a single attribute: batch. It's only purpose is to send the Id of a batch to the batchTable 
component to use in creating the correct list of trainees for the specified batch. This is updated when a user
selects a new batch from the list of filters at the top of the Assess Batch page, which causes the page to reload
with that new batch Id. 

2. DYCOMP

This event is used to create new components within the batchTableRow component, such as the grades for any 
assessments that have been created. Once a new assessment has been made in the ColumnBtn component, it will fire 
this event and send all the required information about that assessment to the batchTable and batchTableRow 
component to use in creating a new note that is linked to that assessment. 

Components involved:
ColumnBtn 
batchTable 
batchTableRow 

3. WEEKCHANGEEVENT

This event is used to carry over the "week" attribute when a user selects a different week than the current one. 
It is passed the week number in the form of an integer, and then sends that integer to the batchTable and 
ColumnBtn component to use in rendering the correct information for that specified week in the table. 

Components involved: 
weekTabMenu
ColumnBtn
batchTable 

4. SENDASSOCIATES

This event is in charge of passing a list of Contacts (trainees) between the batchTable and ColumnBtn components 
so that when a trainer creates a new assessment, it knows which trainees to associate it with. It is fired when 
a user first loads the batchTable component, that way no matter when they create a new assessment, the list will 
already have been send to the ColumBtn component to use that information. 

Components involved: 
ColumnBtn
batchTable

5. TABLEREFRESH

This event is used to trigger an event within the batchTable component, which then reloads the table to adjust 
for any changes made to it. It is called from the ColumnBtn component after a new assessment has been created, 
which would mean that the table would need to be reloaded to include the new assessment column to display it. No 
data is actually sent between the two components, as this event is only used to refresh the table rather than 
use any new information (the batchTable component automatically displays any assessments for the week when it is
loaded, so there is no need to send the new assessment to it in this case).  

Components involved:
ColumnBtn 
batchTable
