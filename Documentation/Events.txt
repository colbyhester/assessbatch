*********** EVENTS ***********

This document is meant to describe the overall functionality that each event is meant to accomplish. For more 
detailed information on how these events are used, visit the documentation for its associated components. 

1. SENDBATCHID

This event has a single attribute: batch. It's only purpose is to send the Id of a batch to the batchTable 
component to use in creating the correct list of trainees for the specified batch. This is updated when a user
selects a new batch from the list of filters at the top of the Assess Batch page, which causes the page to reload
with that new batch Id. 

2. DYCOMP

This event is used to create new components within the batchTableRow component, such as the grades for any 
assessments that have been created. Once a new assessment has been made, it will fire this event and send all the
required information about that assessment to the batchTableRow component to use in creating a new note that is
linked to that assessment. 

3. WEEKCHANGEEVENT

This event is used to carry over the "week" attribute when a user selects a different week than the current one. 
It is passed the week number in the form of an integer, and then sends that integer to the batchTable component
to use in rendering the correct information for that specified week in the table.
